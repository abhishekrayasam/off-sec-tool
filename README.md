# Honeypot Interceptor - Offensive Security Tool

A sophisticated offensive security tool designed to intercept malicious attacks, redirect them to honeypot servers, and serve compromised files that can reveal attacker identity and cripple their infrastructure.

## Features

- **Traffic Interception**: Real-time network traffic monitoring and interception
- **Attack Detection**: Advanced pattern recognition for malicious activities
- **Honeypot Management**: Dynamic honeypot server deployment and management
- **File Replacement**: Serve decoy files that can compromise attacker systems
- **Attacker Fingerprinting**: Collect and analyze attacker behavior patterns
- **Infrastructure Disruption**: Deploy countermeasures against attacker infrastructure
